### my first blog
Hola everyone, welcome to my first blog 
I'm Pradeep Patwa currently studing Electronics and Telecommunication engineering. I'm very passionate about technology and engineering. 
I'm also interested in sustainable developement. I think that artifical inteligence and machine lerning can be a game changing technology for the development of human kind. 
I read that AI is the new electricity which is going to affect each and every people on this planet. AI can also be helpful to tackle climate change and global warning.
Quantum computer is also a evolutionary in the field science.
